# Mermaid Configuration Test

This page tests that per-code-block configuration works correctly and doesn't leak between diagrams.

## Flowchart Tests

### Flowchart 1: Default Theme

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B[Process]
    B --> C[End]
```

### Flowchart 2: Forest Theme

This should use the forest theme. If config isolation works, it should NOT affect Flowchart 1 above.

```mermaid theme="forest"
graph TD
    X[Begin] --> Y[Middle]
    Y --> Z[Finish]
```

## Packet Diagram Tests

### Packet 1: Default Settings

```mermaid
packet-beta
0-15: "Source Port"
16-31: "Destination Port"
32-63: "Sequence Number"
64-95: "Acknowledgment Number"
```

### Packet 2: Custom Row Height

This packet should have a taller row height (80px). If config isolation works, it should NOT affect Packet 1 above.

```mermaid rowHeight="80"
packet-beta
0-15: "Header"
16-31: "Payload"
32-47: "Checksum"
48-63: "Footer"
```

### Packet 3: Custom Bits Per Row (16-bit)

Default is 32 bits per row. This uses 16 bits per row - each row should be half the width.

```mermaid bitsPerRow="16"
packet-beta
0-7: "Byte 1"
8-15: "Byte 2"
16-23: "Byte 3"
24-31: "Byte 4"
```

### Packet 4: Custom Bits Per Row (48-bit)

This uses 48 bits per row - wider rows with more fields fitting horizontally.

```mermaid bitsPerRow="48"
packet-beta
0-15: "Field A"
16-31: "Field B"
32-47: "Field C"
48-63: "Field D"
64-79: "Field E"
80-95: "Field F"
```

## Mixed Config Test

### Flowchart with Dark Theme

```mermaid theme="dark"
graph LR
    A[Input] --> B[Transform]
    B --> C[Output]
```

### Packet with Multiple Options

```mermaid theme="neutral" rowHeight="60" bitsPerRow="32"
packet-beta
0-7: "Version"
8-15: "IHL"
16-31: "Total Length"
```

## Verification Checklist

After the page loads, verify:

1. **Flowchart 1** uses the default theme (matches your site's light/dark mode)
2. **Flowchart 2** uses the green "forest" theme
3. **Packet 1** has default row heights
4. **Packet 2** has noticeably taller rows (80px)
5. **Dark flowchart** has a dark background
6. **Final packet** has neutral theme with custom dimensions

If any diagram's config affects another diagram, the isolation is broken.
