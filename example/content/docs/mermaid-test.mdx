# Mermaid Configuration Test

This page tests that per-code-block configuration works correctly and doesn't leak between diagrams.

## Flowchart Examples

### Basic Flowchart

````md
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B[Process]
    B --> C[End]
```
````

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B[Process]
    B --> C[End]
```

## Packet Diagram Examples

### Packet 1: Default Settings

````md
```mermaid
packet-beta
0-15: "Source Port"
16-31: "Destination Port"
32-63: "Sequence Number"
64-95: "Acknowledgment Number"
```
````

```mermaid
packet-beta
0-15: "Source Port"
16-31: "Destination Port"
32-63: "Sequence Number"
64-95: "Acknowledgment Number"
```

### Packet 2: Custom Row Height

Uses `rowHeight="80"` for taller rows.

````md
```mermaid rowHeight="80"
packet-beta
0-15: "Header"
16-31: "Payload"
32-47: "Checksum"
48-63: "Footer"
```
````

```mermaid rowHeight="80"
packet-beta
0-15: "Header"
16-31: "Payload"
32-47: "Checksum"
48-63: "Footer"
```

### Packet 3: 16 Bits Per Row

Uses `bitsPerRow="16"` - narrower diagram with fewer columns per row.

````md
```mermaid bitsPerRow="16"
packet-beta
0-7: "Byte 1"
8-15: "Byte 2"
16-23: "Byte 3"
24-31: "Byte 4"
```
````

```mermaid bitsPerRow="16"
packet-beta
0-7: "Byte 1"
8-15: "Byte 2"
16-23: "Byte 3"
24-31: "Byte 4"
```

### Packet 4: 48 Bits Per Row

Uses `bitsPerRow="48"` - wider diagram with more columns per row.

````md
```mermaid bitsPerRow="48"
packet-beta
0-15: "Field A"
16-31: "Field B"
32-47: "Field C"
48-63: "Field D"
64-79: "Field E"
80-95: "Field F"
```
````

```mermaid bitsPerRow="48"
packet-beta
0-15: "Field A"
16-31: "Field B"
32-47: "Field C"
48-63: "Field D"
64-79: "Field E"
80-95: "Field F"
```

### Packet 5: Combined Options

Uses both `rowHeight="60"` and `bitsPerRow="16"` together.

````md
```mermaid rowHeight="60" bitsPerRow="16"
packet-beta
0-7: "Version"
8-15: "IHL"
16-23: "DSCP"
24-31: "ECN"
```
````

```mermaid rowHeight="60" bitsPerRow="16"
packet-beta
0-7: "Version"
8-15: "IHL"
16-23: "DSCP"
24-31: "ECN"
```

## Configuration Isolation Test

The diagrams above should each have their own independent configuration. If Packet 1 (default) looks the same width as Packet 3 (16-bit), the configuration is leaking between diagrams.
